[Docker Vacuum](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcopeg/docker-vacuum) is a small DevOps
utility that runs on your production server as a container and
**keeps disk usage under control**.

_Docker Vacuum_ prunes the system every now and then (10 minutes by default) and applies
your custom rules so to remove unused images with a date-based retention policy.

Cron based pruning wasn't quite enough for me because I want to **keep the last _N_ images on my server so I can quickly revert** in case s**t hits the fan. 

Plus, I don't want to risk deleting resources that are
needed by paused containers.

## Try it Out!

On your local machine:

```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock marcopeg/docker-vacuum
```

Or run it as a background service in your production server:

```bash
docker run -d \
-e VACUUM_RULES="[{\"match\":\"(.*)\",\"retain\":2}]" \
-e VACUUM_INTERVAL=600000 \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
marcopeg/docker-vacuum:
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The two environment variables are optional, and the example above implements their default values.

**BUT THE VOLUME CONFIGURATION IS CRITICAL:**  
_Docker Vacuum_ needs to run some Docker commands on your
behalf on the host machine. Without direct access to the Docker socket, it won't work.

## Configuration:

The setting `VACUUM_INTERVAL` defines how often the cleanup activity will take place.
By default, it will run every 10 minutes.

The `VACUUM_RULES` is a _JSON_ stringified object that contains patterns and retention
rules:

    [
        {
            match: 'marcopeg/(.*),
            retain: 2
        },
        {
            match: 'hello-world',
            retain: 0
        }
    ]

This set of rules mean:

1. keep the 2 most recent version for any images whose name starts with "marcopeg/"
2. delete any image whose name is "hello-world"

_Docker Vacuum_ also honors the classic `LOG_LEVEL` setting with values as:
`error, info, verbose, debug`. Most people would run their tests with `verbose`.

## Who Needs Docker Vacuum?

### CapRover:

I'm using [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) to manage some small servers, and I love it.

Although it does a wonderful job in running apps and basic deployment automation, it lacks the ability to clean up after himself.

> So if you deploy a lot on CapRover,
> be perpared to see your disk usage grow fast.

I run _Docker Vacuum_ as a CapRover app and that enables fine-grained control of how to clean up my system and still be able to quickly revert a deployment.

### DockerCompose:

On other instances I use `docker-compose` to run my projects.

In that scenario, I have a _git_ repository set up and my deployment script looks like this:

    git pull
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d

Which is enough to create fresh images out of new code and rotate the containers.
The problem here is that building and building will generate a lot of dangling
and outdated images. Again, disk space might be a problem.

**If you had just one project on your server** you could safely run:

    docker system prune --all --volumes --force

And Docker will magically remove any resource that is not linked with any running
containers. Simple and cool.

But **if you do run multiple projects** and you are not sure they are all running at a given
point in time, the above command **may end up deleting critical stuff**. Not so cool.

_Docker Vacuum_ helps because it prunes the system from dangling resources and also deletes
images based on your custom rules.

## Feedback is Appreciated

Thank you for reading this far!
I appreciate it.

A good way to show you liked it is to **give me a thumb up, a clap or a comment**.

I'm not a social media freak, but I still feel better when I see a warm
human reaction to what I share :-)
