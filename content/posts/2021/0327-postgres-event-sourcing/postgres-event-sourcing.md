Big companies benefit from products like [RabbitMQ][rabbitmq], [Kafka][kafka], or [Elastic Search][elastic-search], **and have the matching economy** to pay for the required resources, mostly clusters of virtual machines.

All the other companies would benefit from the same patterns, **but don't have enough scale to make it efficient**. 

ðŸ‘‰ _Money is always a scarce resource_ ðŸ‘ˆ

> Running a cluster of 3 servers just to store a few million messages in a RabbitMQ queue or Kafka topic is simply too expensive.

A [relational database][relational-database] such [PostgreSQL][postgresql] it is still among **the cheapest options to store large amount of data** in a persistent and reliable way. 

In this series of articles, we're going to **discover a data model** that let us store and consume events in a reliable way, offering the possibility for **concurrent producers/consumers** to work together without race-condition each other.
