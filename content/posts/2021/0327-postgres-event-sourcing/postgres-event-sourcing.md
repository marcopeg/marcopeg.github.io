Big companies benefit from products like [RabbitMQ][rabbitmq], [Kafka][kafka], or [Elastic Search][elastic-search], and have the matching economy to pay for the required resources, mostly clusters of virtual machines.

Most of the companies around this world would benefit from the same patterns, **but don't have enough scale to make it efficient**.

> Running a cluster of 3 servers just to store a few million messages in a RabbitMQ queue or Kafka topic is simply too expensive.

A [relational database][relational-database] such [PostgreSQL][postgres] it is still among the cheapest options to store large amount of data in a persistent and reliable way. 

In series of list of articles, we're going to **discover a data model** that let us store and consume events in a reliable way, offering the possibility for concurrent producers/consumers to work together without race-condition each other.
